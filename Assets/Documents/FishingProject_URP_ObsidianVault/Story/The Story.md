# The Story
### Prologue
The story as I have it thus far revolves around our player character. This player character was among the first generation of immigrants from the Old World. The player character's family came along with them, and together they supported their community by fishing. However, the player character had died suddenly, before their time.

The player character, awakening in the afterlife realm, has lingering regretful feelings about their previous life despite being unable to recall much. Thus, they ask to to return back to their world. Their wish is granted, but on a condition. They are given the duty of being a soul gatherer for fish, given a new, illusory body, and only a certain amount of time *or until they're ready to return*.

### Chapter 1
Initially, the player character dreads their return as a spirit, desperate to try and recall things from their last life, and bound to gather fish spirits. They do not recall who they were in life yet and begin to feel alone. They resign to fishing, gathering their first fish soul.
	*For the first fish the player catches, the player character remembers its species and begins to recall more details about the world they left.*

After catching a few fish, a local Mi'cha fisherman approaches the player character and invites them to their town to sell those fish. The player character accepts, shocked that the fisherman can interact with them. *This fisherman actually turns out to be the spirit of Ormon later*.

When the player character reaches the Mi'cha town, they are met with sights that are vaguely familiar. In the town, there is a fishery, a market with various gear, and more.
	There are people we can talk to in the town who ask for our help catching certain things. We can talk to certain NPCs who offer us dialogue and insight into the lives of the townfolk and the Mi'cha culture.
	Completing quests awards the player with **Compassion**, which helps restore clues.

# Game Mechanics
Calendar Mechanic
	Divides time into Weeks.
		Weeks consist of X Days.
			Days are spent either fishing/exploring an area, spending time in a town, resting, or *potentially* other options.
			Days are timed? (a la Pikmin?)
	Makes time relevant.
		This way, you can place traps places and leave them for some time.

Fishing Mechanic
	Perhaps in an area we must **discover** the fish present, and do not initially know what's there before we discover them.

Compassion
	**Firstly, allows passage to the next worlds.**
	Secondly, allows for more infamy and dialogue options with characters.
