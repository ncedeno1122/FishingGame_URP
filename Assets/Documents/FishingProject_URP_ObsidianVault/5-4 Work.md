I've been working on this project on/off mostly for my environment design class, but now that's OVER! I passed with a full 100% and a neat environment to boot, I'm really excited about that. As well, I also did some more planning about the lore of my project over a cruise to Mexico my family and I went on. It was all very exciting and a welcome break after another semester of school, work, and an impromptu week of horrid sickness.
In any case, I'm back now with so much drive. I'm really excited because for the first time I feel like I can actually back up being skilled with my game design things. I'm looking for summer jobs so I can work to make some dough and applied very excitedly to a few game programming opportunities. I always doubt myself and undersell my abilities, but it's nice to see that I don't have to all the time here. I've been writing code, recording music, modelling, writing lore and making design decisions, and all that. If that's not game design, then I don't know what is!
I left one thing out, and that's project management. I have a goal behind this project (to make it my senior project) and an actual release. If I graduate in 2024, then I have two years to get this out and all that. Mostly though, it's the workflow and attention to detail that I want to capture about my game and all that.

##  Picking up where I left off
According to my previous note and its heading, [[4-11 to 4-12 Work#Problem 1 Casting the Bobber]], I left off deciding that I wanted a fully-simulated and non-kinematic bobber for casting. This would make the game more fun in my opinion, but I have to make sure I work thoroughly with the physics to make things well (for example, how do I make the bobber *float*, much less right itself in the water and *bob*?).

In any case though, I hadn't gotten much further past the casting stage from there though. The main problem I was encountering was in predicting kinematically where the bobber would land, or simulating that in general. I thought it might be useful to do so so that I might show where the bobber would land.
Then again, Animal Crossing doesn't do that. Zelda games (to my knowledge) didn't do that, Stardew didn't, and more. Granted, fishing wasn't one of the core mechanics of the game... But they didn't display that target location as I recall. I haven't yet looked into other fishing games and all that, but I don't think they did that either.

Maybe I don't need to do that, and I just need to have some *strength meter UI* to show the strength of the cast. Kinda like the horse jumping meter in Minecraft or the Stardew fishing one.

The next major changes as I move away from the kinematic system is going to involve a lot of brash, forward action. I'm going to resume work on this tomorrow morning. I'll make tomorrow a day to work on this game.

# IT'S TOMORROW NOW BABY
That's right! It's 10am and the first act of sacrilege I'll commit today involves upgrading my project's version from 2020 to 2021. Initially, I wanted an LTS version of Unity guaranteed to work and not come out with a million new versions that I'd need to ugrade to. Turns out, LTS releases still have that too. I figure I might as well migrate to the Unity-recommended version (there must be a reason it's recommended after all). That said, I'm going to try to do this. Let's hope there's no catastrophic changes and breaks that occur, but there's only one way to find out!
