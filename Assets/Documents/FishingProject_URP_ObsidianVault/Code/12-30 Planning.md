# The Idea Behind The  Game
I've been meaning to make a fishing game forever. So, I got started thinking about some ideas for ways to make just that, a fishing game, and no more. I figured out that the game I wanted to make appeals to the Submission, Fantasy, Discovery, and maybe some Challenge types of fun. In targeting these and **establishing a context** for this, though, I came to realize that I could target Narrative fun/engagement as well. Here's everything I have thought up so far.

## Gameplay Ideas
### Calendar & Time
Perhaps in a Princess Maker 2-esque fashion, you can chart out time to explore the world, go to towns, or do other things.
This would allow for time for things like seasons and events to happen, timed quests and whatnot.

### Multiple Areas
I would like for there to be multiple environments to fish in and observe endemic life. Perhaps traveling from one place to another takes time ([[#Calendar Time]]). In any case, I wanted to try to make a variety of fantastical areas and places for the player to explore, perhaps with some environmental storytelling and things like that.

### Towns & Villages
Towns and Villages are places the player can go to accept quests, buy gear, and perhaps even enjoy town-specific events at certain times.

## The Narrative, Currently
The main character has died for some reason prior to the events of the game. They likely weren't ready to, as they carried a lot of attachment and regret into the afterlife. Being unable to recall who they were, what they had done in life, but nonetheless pining for a chance to return to the world, they were offered a job to be able to roam earth again as a soul collector, **but for fish**. They are granted the ability to appirate, assigned an appearance, and given [[#The Main Fishing Rod]] should they choose this purpose after their death.

Naturally, the main character hastily accepts the job, but initially sees little purpose in collecting the souls for fish. They are frustrated with not being able to remember who they were even after their return to the waking world and seemingly being doomed to fish without end.

However, as they continue to explore, they find solace in the calming activity of fishing, exploring, and being in nature. This is about the time that they begin to get asked for quests in towns. Perhaps a person enlists their fishing skill to help gather enough fish for a jambalaya. There's nothing else really to do except that, so they gather the fish and are invited into the town, where they see the impact of their contribution, allowing the town to enjoy a tasty cultural dish. It feels good to do a nice thing despite knowing not who and where they are, and the main character is told that in towns and villages like these, there are plenty of jobs for anglers like themselves (introducing the [[#Towns Villages]] mechanic).

After leaving the town celebration, the player is introduced to the [[#Calendar Time]] mechanic, where they can choose to gather more fish, or go to the village to accept quests and get gear. **This is sort of the main gameplay loop**, selecting where you want to go, what you want to do, and getting to go do it.

Continuing along the narrative, the player continues to complete quests and do right, finding a lot more meaning in their service as a soul collector, and resolving a lot of their attachments. As well, **they begin to learn a lot more about who they were in life**.
In one area, they discover their old family home, empty but littered with old family heirlooms that are oddly familiar for some reason. In another village, where the main characters' family moved after their death, their partner and children remain. They too carry a sense of familiarity and have hints that they're part of the main characters' family as well, but in conversation with the main character, neither one knows truly who the other is.

(I haven't hashed out an outline for the quests nor about how this development is explored amidst the varying fantastical sights in the world as the player explores it, but I **do know how I'd like the game to end**).

Perhaps after doing right by their family and bringing them together (as an outsider and a spirit nonetheless) one last time, the main character finally is ready to pass on.
After sorting everything out and realizing that they have done everything they've needed to, they return to the afterlife where they were assigned the job as a soul collector. After this, they pass on to the afterlife properly and without regret. ***Perhaps after, their soul returns in the form of a legendary fish in the area the player spent the most time in?***

-- END --

(I've ALWAYS wanted to end something off that way, I feel so accomplished lol!)

### Designs
#### The Main Fishing Rod
Perhaps the main fishing rod has a lantern at the end as well as a hook, to collect the souls of the fish in line with that soul-lantern tradition.
