The goal today was to create this Obsidian Vault, restore the project to its functionality prior to taking a break and migrating render pipelines, and to identify some next steps. Thankfully, I've been able to complete the first two with ease, but I need to complete the third here. Thus,

## Next Steps
My next major goal for the project is to **get the fishing rod casting process working**. What I'm thinking exactly, is, the full process of casting and reeling in the game should be complete.

This process consists of:
- State-based process for casting
- "Gear" system for equipped tools and item slots
- Animation for fishing rod casting, reeling, etc.
- Plane or general hitbox that the bobber hits or something like that, to register what fishing area and fish to pull eventually
